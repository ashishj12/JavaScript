Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
It is an interpreted programminglanguage with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to
JavaScript,possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

**Client-Side JavaScript**

* Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should
* be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
* It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that
* interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
* The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI
* server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
